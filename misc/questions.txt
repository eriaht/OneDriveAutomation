Test install script to see if it captures the same hashes as a manual install

Create scheduled task to avoid UAC for running OneDriveSetup
    - How does teams install avoid UAC prompt?

    - Practical, no-prompt approach

        For your case, I’d recommend:

            Schedule the script to run under SYSTEM or an admin account with “Run with highest privileges” in Task Scheduler.

                This way, even machine-wide installs happen silently.

                No user interaction required.

            Loop the install/update/uninstall cycle so ThreatLocker sees all file versions.

            Pull installer from your version scraper so you can automatically test Insider, Production, and Deferred builds.

            # def cycle_onedrive():
            #     uninstall_onedrive()
            #     install_onedrive()
            #     update_onedrive()
            #     time.sleep(60)  # Give ThreatLocker time to register
