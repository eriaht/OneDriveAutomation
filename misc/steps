Good question. It really comes down to **efficiency** and **control**. Here are the pros and cons of each approach:

---

## **1. Scrape Everything First, Then Check Subversions**

**How it works:**

* Step 1: Scrape all versions and store them in your JSON file or dictionary.
* Step 2: Loop through that list, checking each version for subversions.

**Pros:**

* Separation of concerns: scraping and checking are independent, easier to debug.
* You have a full snapshot of versions before doing network-heavy subversion checks.
* Easier to pause/resume the subversion search later.
* Can reuse the scraped JSON file without re-scraping.

**Cons:**

* Requires two passes (scrape first, then scan).

---

## **2. Check Subversions While Scraping**

**How it works:**

* For each version you scrape, immediately check for subversions before moving to the next version.

**Pros:**

* One continuous pipeline, no intermediate files if you don’t want them.
* If the source website updates often, you always have subversions tied to the scraped version.
* Potentially simpler if the dataset is small.

**Cons:**

* Slower to scrape because each version involves multiple network requests.
* Harder to resume if the script stops mid-way.

---

## **Recommendation for Your Case**

Since you want to **keep track of subversions and installations over time**, the **first approach is better**:

* Scrape once, save everything to `onedrive_versions.json`.
* Then have a separate script or function to read that file and check each version’s subversions, updating `found` and `installed`.

This keeps your data and checks modular. Also, if the Hans Brender page changes, you don’t lose the subversion work you already did.

### Updated Data Structure for Next Step

When you do the subversion search, update each entry like:

```python
{
    "25.160.0818.0001": {
        "date": "08/18/25",
        "ring": "insiders",
        "architectures": ["32bit", "64bit", "arm64"],
        "subversions": {
            "found": ["0002", "0003"],
            "installed": ["0002"]
        }
    }
}
```

---

### How to Use the Existing Scraper with This

Your current scraper makes a **list** of dicts like `[{version: {...}}, {version: {...}}]`.
It’s better to make it a **single dict** keyed by version for easier lookups and updates:

```python
result = {}

for index, row in enumerate(rows):
    if index == 0:
        continue

    cols = row.find_all("td")
    if len(cols) < 3:
        continue

    date = cols[0].text.strip()
    version = cols[1].text.strip()
    arch_links = cols[2].find_all("a")
    architectures = [a.text.strip().lower() for a in arch_links]

    result[version] = {
        "date": date,
        "ring": "insiders",
        "architectures": architectures,
        "subversions": {
            "found": [],
            "installed": []
        }
    }

with open("onedrive_versions.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(result, f, indent=4)
```

Now, later you can do:

```python
with open("onedrive_versions.json") as f:
    versions = json.load(f)

for version in versions:
    # loop through subversions...
    # update versions[version]["subversions"]["found"].append("0002")
```

---

### Summary

* **Scrape first, then scan subversions** is cleaner and easier to maintain.
* Store data as a **single dict keyed by version** to make updating easy.
* Use `found` and `installed` lists for subversions to keep good history.

Would you like me to **write the second script (reads JSON and scans subversions, updates file)** for you? Or **combine everything into one script but modularized with functions**?
