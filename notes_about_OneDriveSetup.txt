For what you’re doing — running OneDrive installs/updates just so ThreatLocker can capture hashes — it’s not *functionally* bad to drop `OneDriveSetup.exe` in your script directory.

But there are a few practical considerations:

---

### **Why keeping it in your script folder is fine**

* Windows doesn’t care where the installer is located — you can run `OneDriveSetup.exe` from anywhere.
* ThreatLocker will still see the execution and resulting file writes.
* It makes cleanup easy (delete the file at the end of the script).

---

### **Why you might want to use a different location**

1. **Avoid clutter**
   If you run multiple cycles and download different versions, your script folder will fill with `.exe` files unless you overwrite each time.

2. **Path issues**
   If your script is stored in a path with spaces or special characters, sometimes `subprocess.run()` calls can be finicky unless you wrap paths in quotes.

3. **Accidental execution**
   If someone browses your script folder and double-clicks `OneDriveSetup.exe`, they could trigger an install outside of your intended cycle.

4. **System conventions**
   Most installers temporarily live in `%TEMP%` or a staging folder (like `C:\Installers`), which is cleaner and easier to manage.

---

### **Best practice for automation**

I’d suggest using the temp directory or a dedicated staging folder:

```python
import tempfile
import os

INSTALLER_PATH = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), "OneDriveSetup.exe")
```

That way:

* It’s out of your working directory.
* It’s easy to clean up after each run:

```python
if os.path.exists(INSTALLER_PATH):
    os.remove(INSTALLER_PATH)
```

---

If you’re going to run **many** versions for ThreatLocker Learning Mode, I’d put installers in a **versioned subfolder** like:

```
C:\OneDriveInstallers\25.149.0803.0002\OneDriveSetup.exe
```

That way ThreatLocker can pick up each binary separately, and you can re-run them later if needed.

---

If you want, I can tweak your cycling script so it **automatically stages installers in `%TEMP%` and deletes them after each cycle**, so you never have clutter. That’ll make your runs cleaner and fully self-contained.
